### 1. Clone the Repository
To clone the repository, use the following corrected command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wormyreadss.git
```
Make sure to replace `yourusername` with the GitHub username where the repository is located.

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning, change into the correct project directory with:

```bash
cd wormyreadss
```

### 3. Install Required Dependencies
Install the necessary Python packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This command installs all dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### 4. Database Setup and Environment Configuration
Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and a database is created for the project. Then, create a `.env` file in the project root with your database connection string and other environment variables:

```plaintext
DATABASE_URL=postgres://USERNAME:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/DATABASE_NAME
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
DEBUG=True # Set to False in production
```

Fill in the placeholders with your actual database credentials and a secure `SECRET_KEY`.

### 5. Run Migrations
Prepare your database by applying migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This sets up the necessary database tables.

### 6. Start the Development Server
To launch the application, start Django's built-in server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will run locally, accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

By following these corrected instructions, you can accurately set up and run the Wormyreadss application on your local machine, reflecting the extra "s" in the project name as noted.
